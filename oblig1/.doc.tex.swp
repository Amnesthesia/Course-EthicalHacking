\section{Foreword}
There has been a few things I've been uncertain about with this assignment. First, I wasn't sure exactly \textbf{how} I was supposed to show the success of some of the steps (unpacked images for example -- unpacking these is a \textit{dependency} for the other steps, as is logging into Kali). Second, I am not sure if I interpreted \textit{Access services on the other hosts - including authentication attempts} correctly. The way I interpreted this is \textit{booting} these images and making sure they work.
It could also have been interpreted as \textit{getting access to} the systems these images contain. The reason I interpreted it as such was because it said \textit{authentication \textbf{attempts}}, and because running a vulnerability scanner was optional. Scanning would probably have been the first thing I tried if this was supposed to mean gaining access to these systems - the motd in these systems speak against this however, but I made the assumptions that rooting them is part of upcoming assignments.

I have also chosen to use VirtualBox over VMware because I see no reason for proprietary software when there's a fully qualified open source equivalent.

\section{Set-up}

Alright, so let's get going -- I will use screenshots and code snippets to make every step I took as clear as possible.

\section{Network}
I set up a VirtualBox Host Adapter with a DHCP-server.\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{nw.png}

\subsection{Creating a VirtualBox Host Adapter}
The host's adapter is located at \textit{192.168.56.2}, and the DHCP server is located at \textit{192.168.56.2}. This leaves \textit{192.168.56.3-254} available for the DHCP IP pool, with 255 as the broadcast address.\\

\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{nw_adapter.png}\\

\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{nw_dhcp.png}\\

As can be seen by the ifconfig output in Kali, Kali was assigned IP 102 on this network. I'd say this sufficiently explains why this IP is private (assuming that by private you mean host-only?), as this network is virtual and run between the VMs.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption={Kali IP-address}]
root@battlestation:~# ifconfig
eth0	Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr: 08:00:27:9f:c1:c6
		inet addr:192.168.56.102 Bcast:192.168.56.255
\end{lstlisting}

I'm not entirely sure how "nmap scan" is any different from "scan for other hosts" either, but here we go!
